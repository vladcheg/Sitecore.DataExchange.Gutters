# Sitecore Data Exchange Gutters
One interesting and cool feature of Sitecore is the ability to use gutters. What more interesting is creating custom gutters. Sitecore gutters can be a very useful way of providing a quick solution for context item of an item within the tree.

The current solutions were designed mainly for [Sitecore Data Exchange Framework](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Data_Exchange_Framework.aspx) (DEF) and its providers. If you are not familiar with DEF, please follow the available [documentation link](http://integrationsdn.sitecore.net/DataExchangeFramework/v1.2/).

There are three available gutters for DEF.
* [DataExchange - Item Disabled](#dataexchange---item-disabled)
* DataExchange - Pipeline Batch
* DataExchange - Pipeline Step

### DataExchange - Item Disabled
By default when you configure a new tenant with its batches and pipelines they are disables. This gutter allow you not only see it, also, it allows you tick it to enabled.
